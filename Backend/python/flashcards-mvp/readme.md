# Workflow

## High-level

1. Define problem/pain points - "What problem are you solving?"
2. User workflow/stories. Create feature file for Behave - i.e.,  Scenario: check that the form displays When I go to the home page Then I should see the login form 
3. Mockup/wireframe. High Fidelty (pen, paper) -> Low Fidelity (bootstrap)
4. Convert user workflow/scenarios into pseudo code - which will eventually become comments
5. Discuss design patterns/programming paradigms.
6. Break workflow/pseudo code into functions. Test with Behave while coding. BDD.
7. Program iteratively, starting lean.
8. Test - Code - Refactor
9. Add integration testing with PhantomJS. Perhaps use some mocking.
