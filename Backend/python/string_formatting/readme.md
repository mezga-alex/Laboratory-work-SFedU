String formatting example:

```
>>> pi = 3.1415926
>>> not_pi = 2.14
>>> "pi is equalled to {}".format(pi)
'pi is equalled to 3.1415926'
>>>
>>> "pi is equalled to {:.2f}".format(pi)
'pi is equalled to 3.14'
>>>
>>> test = "pi is equalled to {:.2f}".format(pi)
>>> test
'pi is equalled to 3.14'
>>> type(test)
<type 'str'>
>>>
```
