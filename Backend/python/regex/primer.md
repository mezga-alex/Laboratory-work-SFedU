# Interlude: Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (also known as regex) provide a powerful syntax for pattern matching in text documents.

## When should you use regular expressions?

Unless you absolutely need to use regular expressions, stick with Python's basic string-matching primitives - like `find` and `replace`. They are *much* easier understand. However, these can only take you so far. I tend to take a lazy approach and start with the primitive functions, then if the code starts becoming overly complex, I'll switch to regular expressions. 

Generally, when you can implement all of your logic in a single predicate, you should string with the primitives.

For example:

```sh
>>> str = 'Explicit is better than implicit.'
>>> print text.find('implicit')
24
```

In the above case we know exactly what we're loooking for. But what happens if we don't? Such as a 10-digit phone number. In that case, we only know that the pattern is an integer, with 10-digits (that may or may not be seperated by a dash or some other character). This is the perfect use case for regex:

```sh
>>> import re
>>> str = "Jack's phone number is 415-690-4993"
>>> phone = re.search(r'\d{3}\D*\d{3}\D*\d{4}$', str)
>>> print phone.group()
415-690-4993
```

Here, we have the regular expression `r'(\d{3})\D*(\d{3})\D*(\d{4})$'`, which includes three sub expressions:

1. `d{3}` matches any three digits
2. `D*` matches any non-digit
3. `d{4}` matches any four digits

What if you have an entire list of phone numbers that need to be standardized into the following format xxxxxxxxxx - and the numbers are in any one of these formats:

1. 555-555-5555
2. 555 555 5555
3. 555.555.5555
4. (555) 555-5555
5. (555)555-5555
6. (555)555.5555

Let's write a quick program to do this.

```python
import re

phone_list = ["555-555-5555","555 555 5555","555.555.5555",
    "(555) 555-5555","(555)555-5555","(555)555.5555"]

pattern = r'\D'

for phone in phone_list:
    phone_num = re.sub(pattern, "", phone)    
    print "Phone Num : ", phone_num
```

Let's look at another quick example.

```python
import re

email_list = ["my@email.com", "@email.com", "my@email"]

pattern = "^[A-Za-z0-9.]+@[A-Za-z0-9.]+.com$"

for email in email_list:
    test = re.findall(pattern, email)    
    print test
```

Here, we are given a list of email addresses, and we are just confirming whether they match the correct pattern - e.g., *something@something.com*.

So, although these are just basic examples, you should understand what a regular is and how to use them. Used correctly, in the right situation, you can save much time when having to parse a string. For further information, please check out these guides and tutorials:
